# Raspbot Team Project

This is an example of a README file for my project.
In this project, we will use raspbot on a Raspberry Pi 4 to perform tasks such as line tracking, QR code recognition, and control device design in C, C++.

## Project Description
Repository for systems programming course assignments

project1: This folder contains the tracking code and QR code files.

project2: This folder contains the final code we used in the demo. 
I also put all the rest of the codes I used (client,server,qr,tracking, etc.) The main.cpp code is the final code I used in the demo, which is a combination of all the codes I used. Only the qr recognition code is C++, the rest of the codes are C code.
